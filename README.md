# ADS-B Flights

This repo contains a list of flights I have tracked on my Raspberry Pi running Pi24.

This repo is using a modified version of [georgeglessner's FlightLogger](https://github.com/georgeglessner/FlightLogger) script which is then uploaded to Github via a cron job that runs every 6 hours.

The Raspberry Pi is set up very close to Heathrow, so a majority of Heathrow takeoffs and landings are captured, as well as anything flying above.
